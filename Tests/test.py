#this is where the file where all tests will come together

#Here I am going to dump a few testing ideas to start with

#tracking population total over the course of simulation to see if the total numbers are right
#tracking the population within each age compartment to see if the number remain constant with the time step passing to observe is there is any abnormal flow patter

# Bring your packages onto the path
import sys, os
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join('..', 'Scripts')))

# Now do your import
from Scripts import *
