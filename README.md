AIforGood Simulator aims to provide epidimology modelling help to humanitarian NGOs who are working to contain coronavirus outbreak in refugee camps. Please fill out the contact form on [our website](https://www.aiforgoodsimulator.com) if you want to get in touch or volunteer with us.

# Model description

(pending a write up from Nick)

# Running the repo

clone the repo and then change to the git directory and then:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here is the workflow in generating CSVs for the report

1. Prepare population level data

⋅⋅⋅Go to **Parameters** folder and open up **Prepare camp parameters.ipynb** where you use the **camp_params_template.csv** modify it with the age data from the camp of interest and save it as a seperate csv file

2. Prepare contact matrix data

⋅⋅⋅Again in the **Parameters** folder, open up **Prepare contact matrix.ipynb** where you use the **Contact_matrix_wuhan.csv** modify it with the csv just being created on camp population level data. Save it as a seperate csv file

3. Change the directories pointing towards the population level data and contact matrix data
* go to **Scripts** and open **initalise_parameters.py** and change the csv import for population data
* go to **Scripts** and open **functions.py** and change the csv import for contact matrix

4. Define the config file used to run the experiment

⋅⋅⋅Can modify the **config.py** under the **Scripts** directory or go into **configs** folder to set up the file and go to **run_model.py** to adjust for the import.

For example:
```python
#running simulation with no intervention
from configs.baseline import camp, population_frame, population, control_dict
```

```python
#running simulation with improving hygiene as an intervention
from configs.hygiene import camp, population_frame, population, control_dict
```

5. Set up the run_model,py (change settings on *load*,*save*,*plot_outputs* and *save_plots*) and run the model from command line
⋅⋅⋅ make sure your current directory is in **Scripts**

```python
python run_model.py
```

6. Retrieve outputs from **CSV_output** folder

⋅⋅⋅ These are the csvs that we will use to make a plot
